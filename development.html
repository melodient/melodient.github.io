			<!--<h1>Software</h1>-->
	 		<p>	
			We have a wealth of experience in software and hardware design covering the full stack from low-level coding on embedded systems all the way up to high-level programming for data science and the web in object-oriented and functional languages.  
			In the past we have undertaken projects using languages including <strong>C</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>, <strong>Objective-C</strong>, <strong>VHDL</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>R</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Assembler</strong>, <strong>MATLAB</strong>, <strong> SQL </strong>, <strong>Scheme</strong>, <strong>Javascript</strong>, <strong>Clojure</strong>, <strong>Max/MSP</strong>, and <strong>PureData</strong>.
			</p>

		
			<h2> Data Science </h2>
			<p>
			We use <strong>R</strong> and <strong>Python/SciPy</strong> for most of our data engineering work and have recently employed these technologies to automate data cleaning and de-duplication processes for a financial publication company based in the City of London.
			</p>

			<h2> Web development </h2>
			<p>
			We have built full stack dynamic websites using <strong>HTML5/CSS/Javascript</strong> for the client side and we are big fans of the <strong>Python/Django</strong> framework backed by <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> for server-side development.  One such site was a project management system for university students; as well as web technologies, we used <strong>LaTeX</strong> on the server to generate PDF reports automatically. More recently we have started experimenting with <strong>ClojureScript</strong> for developing client and server side code.  
			</p>

			<h2> Embedded systems and firmware</h2>
			<p>
				We have experience in embedded hardware and software design using <strong>VHDL</strong> synthsised on <strong>Xilinx FPGAs</strong> and <strong>C</strong> and <strong>assembly language</strong> for different microcontrollers platforms including <strong>ARM</strong> and <strong>MCS51</strong> families.
			</p>

			<h2> Mobile</h2>
			<p>
				We are currently developing apps for Android and iOS with partners in academia and industry. 
			</p>

			<h2> Audio processing and studio design </h2>
			<p>
				With many years of experience in audio research, we specialise in audio processing and studio technology.  We have designed and installed audio recording studio systems and developed designs for acoustic treatment at the MAT studios in Queen Mary University in London.
